__SQL Analytics Project: Exploring an Instagram like Dataset__

__OVERVIEW__
The database schema includes core components of a social media platform, such as user profiles, photos, comments, likes, follows, tags, and the associations between them.

The purpose of this project is to utilize advanced SQL functions to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This exercise demonstrates the application of window functions, grouping, subqueries, and other complex SQL operations to understand user behavior, engagement, and trends within a social media context.


__Database Schema__
The schema used in this project includes the following tables:

a) users: Contains user information such as usernames and account creation timestamps.
b) photos: Stores details about posted photos, including image URLs and user IDs.
c) comments: Contains comments made on photos, along with associated user and photo IDs.
d) likes: Tracks user likes on photos.
e) follows: Records user follow relationships.
f) tags: Manages unique tag names for photos.
g) photo_tags: Links photos with associated tags.

__Project Tasks__
1. Project Tasks
2. Analyze User Engagement
3. Identify Top Hashtags
4. Detect Users Liking All Photos
5. Rank Users by Creation Date
6. Comments with Photo Details
7. Rank Tags by Associated Photos
8. Rank Users by Photo Count

__SQL Functions Utilized__
1. Aggregate Functions: COUNT(), AVG(), for calculating totals and averages.
2. Subqueries: Nested queries for filtering and retrieving complex data.
3. Joins: Combining rows from multiple tables using JOINS.
4. Grouping: GROUP BY to aggregate data and calculate metrics.
5. Ordering: ORDER BY to sort results based on specific columns.
6. Window Functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG() for advanced calculations and rankings.
